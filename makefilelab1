issues I had completing this assignment:
- I was unable to push my initial code from my kate editor terminal to my github repository, even after it asked me for my username and password to my github account.
instead, I had to edit the file directly, and type out my makefile instructions. 

the gcc commands DID work with a few exceptions... but because I couldn't get my git push successfully, I was left to edit the file directly in my github.
